/**
 As it stands, I am currently struggling with figuring out how to manually read in a usd file
 into swift, which is the step that directly needs to happen before this. The file must be read in,
 and a Building object must be created, which contains all the rooms that are detailed in the usd
 file.
 
 Within the USD file, it has the features of a room, such as the floor dimensions, door dimensions
 and wall dimensions, and any other furniture that may be inside the room
 
 We only really care about the doors. When turning this building object
 into an unweighted graph by using the nodify function, the algorithm matches up doors present in different rooms,
 and creates a path between two nodes (rooms) in the unweighted graph.
 
 Eventually we will care more about the floorspace and the walls, but I'm just trying to get it working
 for one floor structures.

 Because I can't figure out how to read from the usd file, I'm just going to create a bunch of rooms with doors manually
 from a diagram that I have drawn, so the graph-making algorithm works
